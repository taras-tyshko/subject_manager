Subject: Subject Manager - Interview Task Completed

Hi Desi,

I'm pleased to inform you that the Subject Manager interview task has been completed!

Repository: https://github.com/taras-tyshko/subject_manager

All requested features have been implemented:
✅ Filtering & sorting with real-time search
✅ Subject detail pages
✅ Admin CRUD interface
✅ GitHub CI/CD pipeline
✅ Comprehensive test suite (152 tests, 78.81% coverage)

During development, I found and fixed a bug in the original codebase (incorrect field validation in subject.ex).

Regarding image uploads: I implemented a simple text input approach since the requirements didn't specify the method. If you'd prefer file upload functionality, drag-and-drop, or another approach, I'm happy to implement it.

The project includes:
- Clean, well-tested code following Phoenix best practices
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with automated testing
- Detailed README with setup instructions
- 0 Credo issues (strict mode)

I'm available to answer questions or make adjustments based on your feedback.

Best regards,
Taras Tyshko
